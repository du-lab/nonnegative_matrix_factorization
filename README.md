# Non-negative Matrix Factorization

Java-implementation of non-negative matrix factorization. A non-negative matrix *X* is factorized 
into the product of two matrices *W* and *H*, such that the distance between *X* and *WH* is 
minimal.

##### Implemented distance org.dulab.nmf.measures

- Euclidean distance || *X* &minus; *WH* ||<sup>2</sup>. 

- Generalized Kullback-Leibler divergence &sum; ( *X* log ( *X* / *WH* ) &minus; *X* &plus; *WH* ).

##### Implemented update rules

- Multiplicative update rules for Euclidean and Kullback-Leibler distances with regularization 
terms. Based on [D. Lee and H. Seung, Algorithms for Non-negative Matrix 
Factorization](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/1861-algorithms-for-non-negative-matrix-factorization).

- Fast-gradient-descent update rules for Euclidean and Kullback-Leibler distance with
regularization terms. Based on [N. Guan et al., Non-Negative Patch Alignment 
Framework](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5936739/).

##### Implemented org.dulab.nmf.algorithms

- Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), performed by alternating updates of matrices *W* and *H* to
minimize the distance between *X* and *WH*.

- Non-negative optimization, performed by updating matrix *H* to minimize the distance between 
*X* and *WH*.

- Non-negative singular value decomposition (NNDSVD), used to initialize matrix *W* and *H*. Based on 
[C. Boutsidis and E. Gallopoulos, SVD based initialization: A head start for nonnegative matrix 
factorization](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031320307004359).
